# Kyuday-project-Lea

This repository contains the work I have done during my intership at Kyushu University from August 2021 until March 2022.
My work focused on animating characters in complex environments such as rooms filled with pieces of furniture. In the future, we'll aim at making an application for interior designers, architects or anyone interested, to visualize in VR the 3D environments they created.

My work is part of a bigger project : you can find all the information about it on this website https://learostoker.github.io/Kyuday-Tsubsa-project.github.io/

To achive that goal, we used multiple existing projects such as POSA (https://github.com/mohamedhassanmus/POSA) and SAMP (https://github.com/mohamedhassanmus/SAMP)

This is still a work in progress, the application is not fully done but if you want to use want we have now, please follow the tutorial bellow.

#Tutorial

# Place multiple characters in a room using POSA 

## SDF

SDF stands for Signed Distance Function (or Field). It is a way of describing a 2D or 3D environment and it is used by POSA to place characters in a scene.
Thus, if we want to use POSA with our own custom scene, we will need this file for each new scene mesh we create. 

## Semantics 

POSA also needs files describing the scene's semantics. Our algorithm described above also handle the creation of the semantic files.
However you need to prepare your mesh in a certain way. We used Blender so we'll explain the process with this software.

### Mesh preparation
First, make you organize your meshes properly in your scene : 
  - each piece of furniture should be under a collection (ex. all elements of a chair shoild be in a same collection)
  - the collection should be named according to POSA's semantic naming (https://github.com/mohamedhassanmus/POSA/blob/main/mpcat40.tsv)

In the SDF folder that you chose, you will find a Python script (BlenderScript) that you will need to add to your Blender mesh file.
In "Scripting"ï¼Œclick on "+ New" and name your file.

     alt="add script to blender file"
     style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" />
     
Then you can add the code. Yopu will find it in the SDF folder you chose, it's named "BlenderScript", just copy/paste it into Blender.
Don't forget to change the path of the export folder.

Once you're satisfied with your scene, in "Scripting", click the play button to export each part of your scene to the desired folder.

## Use the SDF algorithm



### Two methods to compute the SDF and semantics files
Now that your data is ready, you can get the SDF and semantic description of your scene. 
To do so, you can use either of the SDF folders in this repository. They both output the same files but using different methods, thus the results might differ. 
One uses a raycasting approach (SDF - Rays) whereas the other one requires a tetrahedralized mesh (SDF - Tetra). The SDF is then calculated by making tests on each single tetrahedra to know if our point is inside or outside of it.
We recommend starting with the raycasting method as it requires less preparation. This method works well on scene filled with simple lowpoly / blocky furniture. If your scene is more complex, we advise you to make a "simple" version of it with really simple pieces of furniture. As long as it reproduces the volume of the object, it will work with POSA. In the end, you can replace the "simple" version of your scene by the original one. 
This requires easy work on Blender but it will facilitate the next steps.

### SDF - Rays
#### REQUIREMENTS
Visual Studio
Anaconda -> Python 3.x
cmake
CUDA
cudnn

#INSTALL
Run cmake file
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -D_CUDA_=TRUE -G"Visual Studio 16 2019"
cmake .. -D_APPLE_=TRUE -G"Xcode"
make

### SDF - Tetra
If you chose this method, you will have to prepare the tetrahedralized mesh first and the following steps will be the same as above.

## POSA 
### Installation 

You first need to install POSA on your device. You can follow the instructions on their GitHub page :
