# Kyuday-project-Lea

This repository contains the work I have done during my intership at Kyushu University from August 2021 until March 2022.
My work focused on animating characters in complex environments such as rooms filled with pieces of furniture. In the future, we'll aim at making an application for interior designers, architects or anyone interested, to visualize in VR the 3D environments they created.

My work is part of a bigger project : you can find all the information about it on this website https://learostoker.github.io/Kyuday-Tsubsa-project.github.io/

To achive that goal, we used multiple existing projects such as POSA (https://github.com/mohamedhassanmus/POSA) and SAMP (https://github.com/mohamedhassanmus/SAMP)

This is still a work in progress, the application is not fully done but if you want to use want we have now, please follow the tutorial bellow.

#Tutorial

## SDF
### What is an SDF and why do we need it ?

SDF stands for Signed Distance Function (or Field). It is a way of describing a 2D or 3D environment and it is used by POSA to place characters in a scene.
Thus, if we want to use POSA with our own custom scene, we will need this file for each new scene mesh we create

## POSA 
### Installation 
You first need to install POSA on your device. You can follow the instructions on their GitHub page :
